# Intro

I am currently a PhD student at the University of Notre Dame in the Computer Science and Engineering department. I work with [Tim Weninger](https://timweninger.com/), studying AI, HCI, and ethics. 

I previously worked with Nate Kremer-Herman at Seattle University, where we studied algorithmic ethics using a social simulation called [Sugarscape](https://github.com/nkremerh/sugarscape). I graduated with a BS in Computer Science in 2024. 

If you think I can be helpful to you or your cause, or if you're interested in collaborating, feel free to get in touch.


# Outside of Work

While my PhD is keeping me very busy, I periodically make attempts at "work-life balance". I love painting my nails, and it's definately the hobby I keep up with the best. I have a knitting group, and I enjoy designing and sewing clothing. 

I have also been caught on occasion swimming, running, and lifting. My mom and I have competed in tri- and bi-athelons together, and while I am a much stronger swimmer, she will find a way to beat me on the run. It keeps me humble.
